FSH contains  and  non-covalently linked subunits. The  subunit is structurally similar to that of human LH, TSH, and hCG. The  subunit is hormone-specific and differs in its structure.\nFSH in the female stimulates the growth and maturation of ovarian follicles by acting directly on the receptors located in the granulosa cells; follicular steroidogenesis is promoted, which, in turn, stimulates LH production, i.e. the LH surge.\nThe midcycle LH surge produces ovulation. Therefore, FSH, LH and other steroid hormones play important roles in regulating the ovulation and ovarian functions during the menstrual cycle. The hormone levels are used to assess the menstrual cycle for pinpointing ovulation or the determination of menopause, and finally for monitoring of endocrine therapy.Made in United States 100% satisfaction guaranteed \nRemove the Walgreen one step FSH Test stick from its foil wrapper by tearing along the splice and removing the device from the pouch. \nRemove the overcap. \nHold the thumb grip of the test stick and position the device so that the \"result window\" is facing you. \nTurn the device so that the absorbent tip on the test stick is pointing downward and stream the urine on the exposed absorbent tip of the test stick for 5 seconds. \nAlternatively, you may immerse the exposed absorbent tip of the test stick into the cup with urine for 10 seconds.Important: do not allow the urine level to go above the plastic housing of the test stick.

Turn your hairstyle into a work of art with the Bed Head Wave Artist Tourmaline Ceramic Deep Waver.

Multiple Heat Settings make your new favorite waver ideal for all hair types, from thin to coarse.

Made in CHINA How to Get the Look: Starting at the roots, lightly clamp a small section of hair between the barrels and hold for a few seconds. For continuous waves, match the outermost wave and work it down your hair. How to use-When using the waver for the first time, select the LOWEST heat setting and test in one small section of hair for 5 to 8 seconds. If you want to use a higher setting, be sure to GRADUALLY increase the temperature. Never style hair for the first time on a high setting as this may damage your hair.   Helen of Tory L.P.Show More\n\nDO NOT wrap cord around appliance while in storage.

Since then, we have continued Dr. Crandall's concept of healthy beauty.\" To this day, every one of our products is carefully crafted and tested to meet our strict requirements: they are hypoallergenic, safe for sensitive skin and eyes, and created without any of the 150+ known harsh ingredients found in other personal care items.\nBlushing Island Glow: Give your face the radiant goddess glow of the tropics. This ultra-creamy blush delivers a long-lasting natural-blushed Tahitian look to your face while providing a gorgeous water-resistant matte finish.\n\n  Nourishing + Moisturizing: Made with a blend of monoi butter, murumuru butter, cupuacu butter, and tucuma butter from the nutrient-rich Amazon, this makeup is packed with essential fatty acids and pro-vitamins that soften, condition, and moisturize the skin.\n  Smooth Application: Whether you use a makeup brush or even just your fingers, cosmetics from the Butter Collection glide on with ease and seamlessly blend into the skin for attractive all-day coverage.\n  Made for Sensitive Skin: Physicians Formula makeup is specifically formulated with your skin's health and comfort in mind. That's why we use high-quality ingredients, that leave you looking and feeling beautiful from the inside out.\n  Cruelty-Free: All Physicians Formula foundations, eye makeup, lipsticks, and other cosmetics are always cruelty-free and never tested on animals.\n\nMade in China May be worn alone or over makeup.

Use a new condom for every sex act. Lesions, pre-ejaculate secretions, semen, vaginal secretions and blood can all transmit infectious organisms. 2. Tear open the package carefully. Do not use fingernails, teeth or scissors or anything that can damage the condom. 3. Before any sexual contact, place the condom on the head of the erect penis. Be sure the rolled-up ring is on the outside. And leave space at tip to hold semen when you come. 4. Squeeze tip gently so no air is trapped inside. Hold tip while you unroll condom all the way to the base of the erect penis. If the condom doesn't unroll, it may be on backwards, damaged or too old. Throw it away and start over with a new condom. 5. Immediately after ejaculation, hold the condom in place and withdraw the penis while it is still erect. Avoid spilling semen. 6.

Since then, we have continued Dr. Crandalls concept of healthy beauty. To this day, every one of our products is carefully crafted and tested to meet our strict requirements: they are hypoallergenic, safe for sensitive skin and eyes, and created without any of the 150+ known harsh ingredients found in other personal care items. \n\n  Multi-Colored Blush: Blendable and buildable, this ultra-creamy blush gently adds a splash of color across the cheeks for instant radiance. \n  Nourishing + Moisturizing: Made with a blend of murumuru butter, cupuacu butter, and tucuma butter from the nutrient-rich Amazon, this makeup is packed with essential fatty acids and pro-vitamins that soften, condition, and moisturize the skin. \n  Smooth Application: Whether you use a makeup brush or even just your fingers, cosmetics from the Butter Collection glide on with ease and seamlessly blend into the skin for attractive all-day coverage. \n  Made for Sensitive Skin: Physicians Formula makeup is specifically formulated with your skin's health and comfort in mind. That's why we use high-quality ingredients, that leave you looking and feeling beautiful from the inside out. \n  Cruelty-Free: All Physicians Formula foundations, eye makeup, lipsticks, and other cosmetics are always cruelty-free and never tested on animals.\nMade in Mexico May be worn alone or over makeup.

LBL stands for Light Bladder Leakage, and it affects millions of women. In fact, 1 in 3 women experience Light Bladder Leakage (LBL). LBL is the frequent involuntary leakage of urine. Why do I have bladder leaks? Some of the most common reasons for uninvited leaks include: Physical changes from childbirth to menopause. Being overweight. Complications from surgery, stroke, or chronic diseases. Bladder or urinary tract infections. Bladder irritants. Can I prevent leaks? There are healthy habits you can maintain in order to help prevent leaks. Track your triggers - Look for patterns in how your bladder reacts to certain spicy and acidic foods and beverages. Exercise regularly - Reduce leaks by strengthening the muscles of your pelvic floor. Drink more water - Drink six to seven 8-ounce glasses of water a day to prevent irritation. Can I use my FSA? Yes, you can. Poise products are FSA-eligible - only applicable in the US. Will my shipping box have what's inside written on it? No, it will not.

To stay dry all day, choose an antiperspirant to help control sweat. If you need something to keep you feeling fresh, choose an aluminum-free deodorant instead. Our Dove 0% Deodorant gives you up to 24 hours of odor protection. If all you're searching for is odor protection in a deodorant without aluminum, try Dove 0% Deodorant. With crisp cucumber & green tea fragrance, this uplifting deodorant adds an extra burst of freshness to your routine. It's the perfect way to start the day, helping you to feel fresher for longer.Made in United States ©UnileverShow More\n\n\nFOR EXTERNAL USE ONLY \nDO NOT USE ON SKIN. \nSTOP USE IF RASH OR IRRITATION OCCURS.","ingredients":[],"category":{"$oid":"303030303030333631343431"},"certificationStatus":"none","cancerScore":1,"allergyScore":1,"environmentScore":1,"overallScore":1,"images":[{"$oid":"62e3a30ed46329b491868a49"},{"$oid":"62e3a30ed46329b491868a4b"},{"$oid":"62e3a30ed46329b491868a4d"},{"$oid":"62e3a30ed46329b491868a4f"},{"$oid":"62e3a30ed46329b491868a51"}],"__v":1}

The CeraVe story began in 2005 after experts noticed that many skin conditions such as acne, eczema, psoriasis and dry skin all had one thing in common: a compromised skin barrier. Developed with dermatologists, CeraVe offers a complete line of skincare products that contain three essential ceramides enhanced with a revolutionary delivery system to help restore the skin's natural protective barrier.   \n*If used as directed with other sun protection measures \n**IQVIA, ProSource Survey, Q1-Q4 2020 Made in United States(of US and/or imported ingredients) \n  Apply CeraVe Sunscreen Body Lotion SPF 30 liberally 15 minutes before sun exposure. \n  Reapply at least every 2 hours and immediately after towel drying. \n  Use a water resistant sunscreen if swimming or sweating. \n\nMineral-based UV filters form a protective barrier to help reflect UV rays away from the skin's surface.
