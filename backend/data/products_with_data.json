FSH contains  and  non-covalently linked subunits. The  subunit is structurally similar to that of human LH, TSH, and hCG. The  subunit is hormone-specific and differs in its structure.\nFSH in the female stimulates the growth and maturation of ovarian follicles by acting directly on the receptors located in the granulosa cells; follicular steroidogenesis is promoted, which, in turn, stimulates LH production, i.e. the LH surge.\nThe midcycle LH surge produces ovulation. Therefore, FSH, LH and other steroid hormones play important roles in regulating the ovulation and ovarian functions during the menstrual cycle. The hormone levels are used to assess the menstrual cycle for pinpointing ovulation or the determination of menopause, and finally for monitoring of endocrine therapy.Made in United States 100% satisfaction guaranteed \nRemove the Walgreen one step FSH Test stick from its foil wrapper by tearing along the splice and removing the device from the pouch. \nRemove the overcap. \nHold the thumb grip of the test stick and position the device so that the \"result window\" is facing you. \nTurn the device so that the absorbent tip on the test stick is pointing downward and stream the urine on the exposed absorbent tip of the test stick for 5 seconds. \nAlternatively, you may immerse the exposed absorbent tip of the test stick into the cup with urine for 10 seconds.Important: do not allow the urine level to go above the plastic housing of the test stick.

Why we love it: It lengthens, with an extreme extension formulation. The creamy emulsion perfectly balances synthetic, plant-derived waxes and film-forming agents. It lifts, taking lashes to new heights with a gentle-on-eyes agent. It defines, thanks to an ergonomic 2-way fibre technology wand. The cutting-edge wand hugs and coats each lash after just one coat. It stretches, for bigger, brighter, wide-awake eyes. It volumizes, infused with hyaluronic acid to rehab and rebuild weak lashes. Why you love it: 94% saw dramatically longer lashes. 93% saw an instant lash lift. Over 90% saw all day wear results. 88% saw one swipe impact. 86% saw zero transfer. *Results observed in a consumer panel survey *Could this be the world's best mascara? Find out for yourself.

The #1 dermatologist recommended body wash, Dove Refreshing Body Wash revitalizes your skin and senses with cucumber and green tea extracts while moisturizing your skin. This body wash is sulfate and paraben-free with a mild, pH-balanced formula, making it a great body wash for dry skin, unlike typical bath soap or shower gel. This body wash uses Dove Moisture Renew Blend, a combination of skin-natural nourishers and plant-based moisturizers. The lipids and glycerin in our formula absorb deeply into the top layers of skin, where they get right to work! This proprietary blend of moisturizing ingredients is proven to work with your skin to nourish it, so it can maintain and create new moisture. \n\nFor best results, squeeze the refreshing cucumber and green tea body wash into your hand or onto a shower pouf and work it into a rich lather. Massage it over your skin, taking time to allow the cooling green tea and cucumber to waken your senses. Rinse off, revealing revived and refreshed skin. \nMade with 100% gentle cleansers, Dove Refreshing Body Wash is gentle to skin's microbiome, its living protective layer. It creates a rich lather that moisturizes and replenishes skin while also leaving it cleansed, revived, and refreshed. Dove body wash is also effective at cleansing hands. \nWith naturally derived cleansers and skin-natural nutrients, we care about what goes into our body wash. Dove sulfate-free body wash is #1 dermatologist recommended and microbiome gentle. Dove care goes further than moisturizing body wash with PETA Cruelty-Free certification and 100% recycled plastic bottles. \nAt Dove, our vision is of a world where beauty is a source of confidence, and not anxiety. So, we are on a mission to help the next generation of women develop a positive relationship with the way they look-reaching over of a billion young people with self-esteem education by 2030. \nWe are committed to a landmark new initiative as part of our 2025 commitment to reduce plastic waste-reducing over 20,500 metric tons of virgin plastic annually by making the iconic beauty bar packaging plastic-free globally, launching new 100% recycled plastic bottles and trialing a new refillable deodorant format that radically reduces plastic use.

Use a new condom for every sex act. Lesions, pre-ejaculate secretions, semen, vaginal secretions and blood can all transmit infectious organisms. 2. Tear open the package carefully. Do not use fingernails, teeth or scissors or anything that can damage the condom. 3. Before any sexual contact, place the condom on the head of the erect penis. Be sure the rolled-up ring is on the outside. And leave space at tip to hold semen when you come. 4. Squeeze tip gently so no air is trapped inside. Hold tip while you unroll condom all the way to the base of the erect penis. If the condom doesn't unroll, it may be on backwards, damaged or too old. Throw it away and start over with a new condom. 5. Immediately after ejaculation, hold the condom in place and withdraw the penis while it is still erect. Avoid spilling semen. 6. Dispose of a used condom by wrapping it in a tissue and throwing it in the trash.

The PT500 offers a simple menu-driven operation allowing you to take a test, set specific alarm points or check how many tests have been performed.  The PT500 has a brilliant 4-digit test result display that can pick up trace amounts of alcohol-examples such as 0.003% or 0.006% BAC -which is the perfect solution for zero-tolerance testing environments screening for the presence of small amounts of alcohol.\n\n  PT Core Fuel Cell provides more reliable, consistent and accurate results as compared with semi-conductor breathalyzers.\n  PT Core Fuel Cell will reduce false positives for someone who is diabetic or on a low calorie diet. Other semiconductor breathalyzers will sometimes show a false positive result for these individuals but the PT Core is not subject to interference from ketones which can be seen in conditions such as diabetes or people on fad diets.\n  The PT500 also exhibits a linear response to measured alcohol, allowing the unit to provide more accurate and consistent results over the complete range of alcohol concentrations.  This is especially true at higher BAC concentrations, such as 0.255% BAC, where the PT Core Fuel Cell will provide more reliable and consistent results whereas semiconductor models may become less accurate at the higher BAC ranges.\n  PT Core extends the life of the sensor and allows for 1000s of tests to be performed. \n  The AlcoHAWK PT500 Breathalyzer utilizes a highly accurate and reliable PT Core fuel cell sensor technology.  This enhanced technology allows the PT500 to be operated as a screening device for professional, medical, and law enforcement testing applications.\n  The PT500 is the perfect choice for law enforcement, hospitals, clinics, businesses, and for personal use -- anytime and anywhere fuel-cell accuracy is required rely on the PT500! \nMade in China 1 year manufacturer warranty.

LBL stands for Light Bladder Leakage, and it affects millions of women. In fact, 1 in 3 women experience Light Bladder Leakage (LBL). LBL is the frequent involuntary leakage of urine. Why do I have bladder leaks? Some of the most common reasons for uninvited leaks include: Physical changes from childbirth to menopause. Being overweight. Complications from surgery, stroke, or chronic diseases. Bladder or urinary tract infections. Bladder irritants. Can I prevent leaks? There are healthy habits you can maintain in order to help prevent leaks. Track your triggers - Look for patterns in how your bladder reacts to certain spicy and acidic foods and beverages. Exercise regularly - Reduce leaks by strengthening the muscles of your pelvic floor. Drink more water - Drink six to seven 8-ounce glasses of water a day to prevent irritation. Can I use my FSA? Yes, you can. Poise products are FSA-eligible - only applicable in the US. Will my shipping box have what's inside written on it? No, it will not.

Developed with dermatologists, CeraVe offers a complete line of skincare products that contain three essential ceramides enhanced with a revolutionary delivery system to help restore the skin's natural protective barrier.   \n*If used as directed with other sun protection measures \n**IQVIA, ProSource Survey, Q1-Q4 2020 Made in United States(of US and/or imported ingredients) \n  Apply CeraVe Sunscreen Body Lotion SPF 30 liberally 15 minutes before sun exposure. \n  Reapply at least every 2 hours and immediately after towel drying. \n  Use a water resistant sunscreen if swimming or sweating. \n\nMineral-based UV filters form a protective barrier to help reflect UV rays away from the skin's surface. Because the ingredients in a mineral sunscreen stay on the surface of the skin to help protect it, a white cast can sometimes remain after applying the product. Follow these tips to apply your mineral sunscreen:  \n\n  Dispense a small amount to one palm and rub your hands together.  \n  Apply to one area of the body at a time and thoroughly massage into the skin.  \n  The formula should spread easily without leaving a greasy residue or feel. \n ©CeraVeShow More\n\nFor external use only.
